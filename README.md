# React Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## How to Play

- The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty spot on the board.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all spots on the board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
